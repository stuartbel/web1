        <h2>Ongoing Maintenance</h2>
        Some other web development companies create a website for their clients and 
        leave them hanging. Here at <strong>Seattle Web Design</strong>, we understand that websites 
        aren't permanent. They need to be taken care of, they break due to excessive
         activity, updating software, and they need security updates. You might also 
         want to update your website with more current information or new content. By paying
          our monthly retainer, you will have access to every 
          one of our other services, whenever you need them.

        <h2>Graphics</h2>
        No matter who you are,
         we believe your website should look amazing, and exactly the way you want it to.
          At <strong>Seattle Web Design</strong> headquarters, we have a team of artists, graphic
           designers, and photographers to spruce up your online presence. They help with 
           almost anything visual, including:
        <ul>
            <li>Logo design</li>
            <li>Website banner creation</li>
            <li>Business photography</li>
            <li>Personal headshots</li>
            <li>Short animations</li>
        </ul>
        And if you need something visual that our current team can't do, we will find someone who can, guaranteed.

         <h2>Web security</h2>
         One of the most important aspects of web design is security. We believe our clients should never have to deal with 
         hacked accounts, or stolen information. Cyberattacks cause a lot of headaches, and we want to prevent that. 
         We have hired a top-level cybersecurity team who makes our websites free from vulnerabilities,
        and makes them safe from any kind of cyberattack.

        <h2>Search Engine Optimization</h2>
        Here at <strong>Seattle Web Design</strong>, we work hard on our websites, and we want our work to be seen. 
        With search engine optimization, we will make sure that every piece of content on your website works well in the search algorithm.
        This means no one will ever have to go scrolling through pages of Google results to find your website.

        <h2>Advertisement</h2>
        We believe that your website should be seen. One of the biggest ways your website can gain traffic is through advertisement.
         For an affordable price, we will design and roll out advertisements that are perfectly designed to catch the eye.
          We also offer social media management to create and maintain a professional online presence for your business.
